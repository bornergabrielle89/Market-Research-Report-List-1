<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CMF Fixation System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable</li><li>Non-absorbable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The CMF Fixation System market is segmented into two main types: absorbable and non-absorbable. Absorbable fixation systems are designed to dissolve in the body over time, eliminating the need for removal and promoting healing in cranio-maxillofacial surgeries. Non-absorbable systems, on the other hand, provide permanent stability and are made from materials that remain intact within the body, making them suitable for long-term applications. Both types serve critical roles in surgical procedures, addressing specific patient and procedural needs.</p></p>
