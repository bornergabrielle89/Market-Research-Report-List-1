<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bus Steering Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Power Steering</li><li>Manual Steering</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bus steering systems are categorized into **Power Steering** and **Manual Steering** markets. **Power Steering** uses hydraulic or electric systems to reduce driver effort, offering smoother control, especially in heavy or large buses. It enhances maneuverability and reduces fatigue. **Manual Steering** relies solely on driver strength, making it simpler and cost-effective but less efficient for larger vehicles. Power steering dominates modern buses due to comfort and safety, while manual systems are rare, typically found in older or smaller models. Both systems cater to varying operational needs and budgets.</p></p>
