<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Metal Ventilation Fan Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Axial</li><li>Centrifugal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The metal ventilation fan market is primarily divided into two types: axial and centrifugal fans. Axial fans move air parallel to the fan's axis, making them suitable for applications requiring high airflow at low pressure, such as cooling and ventilation in buildings. In contrast, centrifugal fans generate airflow perpendicular to their axis, producing higher pressure and capable of moving air through longer ducts, making them ideal for industrial processes and larger-scale ventilation systems. Both types serve essential roles in various sectors.</p></p>
