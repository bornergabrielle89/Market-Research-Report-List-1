<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Magnetite Iron Ore Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Primarily Hematite</li><li>Magnetite</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The magnetite iron ore market primarily consists of three types: hematite, magnetite, and others. Hematite, with its high iron content (around 70%), is the most commonly mined and traded iron ore, valued for its direct use in steel production. Magnetite, though lower in iron content (around 60-65%), is prized for its magnetic properties, making it easier to process and concentrate. The "others" category includes lesser-known ores like goethite and limonite, which have lower iron content and are less economically significant but still contribute to niche markets.</p></p>
