<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Supercharger Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal</li><li>Twin-Screw</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive supercharger market includes two main types: Centrifugal and Twin-Screw. Centrifugal superchargers use a compressor wheel to draw in and compress air, delivering power at higher RPMs, making them ideal for high-speed performance. Twin-Screw superchargers feature intermeshing screws to compress air, providing immediate boost and consistent power across all RPM ranges, suitable for low-end torque and quick acceleration. Both enhance engine performance by increasing air intake, but differ in design, efficiency, and power delivery characteristics.</p></p>
